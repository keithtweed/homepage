            Hello! My name is Keith Tweed, and I'm a university student studying Computing Science at the University of
            Alberta.

        <p>
            My hobbies include coding, amateur radio, fountain pens, mechanical keyboards, gaming, coffee, and tea.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since April 2023, I have been the Communications Director at <a href="https://www.narc.net">The Northern
                Alberta Radio Club</a>. I have an Advanced certification in amateur radio, and I mainly operate on
            VHF/UHF analog and DMR, but am hoping to get onto HF in the near future. I also experiment with data modes
            such as VARA, AX.25, and LoRa. Amateur radio allows me to learn more about electronic components and radio
            wave behaviour and propogation at a hobbyist level, and allows for contact with people around the world.</p>

        <p>
            I joined <a href="https://albertasat.ca/">AlbertaSat</a> in February 2023, and became the communications
            team lead in September 2023. AlbertaSat is a group at the University of Alberta focused on designing and
            building satellites. I came into AlbertaSat through my interest in amateur radio, and so far much of my time
            here has been focused on our submission for the <a href="https://birds-x.birds-project.com/">BIRDS-X
                project</a> competition from Kyutech. Throughout this project, I've learned loads about project
            management, hardware development, prototyping, and the AX.25 packet radio standard.
