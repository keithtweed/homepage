            Hello! My name is Keith Tweed, and I'm a university student studying Computing Science at the University of
            Alberta.

        <p>
            My hobbies include coding, amateur radio, fountain pens, mechanical keyboards, gaming, and tea.
        </p>

        <p>
            I currently have a Basic with Honours certification in amateur radio, and am working to study towards an
            Advanced certification in the future. I mainly operate on VHF/UHF analog and DMR, but am hoping to get onto
            HF in the near future. Amateur radio allows me to learn more about electronic components and radio wave
            behaviour and propogation at a hobbyist level, and allows for contact with people around the world.</p>

        <p>
            I enjoy writing with fountain pens since it allows for a more unique and fun experience with an everyday task. It can make revision and note-taking much more interesting with a variety of fun colours and pens that all behave differently, and more intricately. Plus, it can help to save plastic waste from disposable pens by having reusable, more durable pens.
        </p>

        <p>
            In a similar vein, mechanical keyboards can make the typing I do on a daily basis more enjoyable, and can have ergonomic benefits as well. I switch between a 60%, an ortholinear 40%, and a split ergo 40%, all with linear switches. I've got a numberpad in the works as well, and will attempt to lube the switches for that myself to get a smoother feel to the key presses.
        </p>

        <p>
            In terms of video games, I particularily enjoy MMOs such as Destiny 2, and Final Fantasy XIV: Online. While there can be quite a time-sink into the grind, I think it's incredibly rewarding to finally finish the objectives that you've been working towards, and find that the journey is so much more than just a way to your goal. I also enjoy FPS games such as Overwatch, as well as other genres including games like Pok√©mon and Super Smash Bros. I also have a huge passion for VR, particularily social VR games such as ChilloutVR and NeosVR.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tea is the beverage that the most people drink, other than water. I enjoy making loose leaf tea as it tastes better than bagged tea, and the deliberate act of making tea can act as a nice respite from the task I was doing before. I love black teas, and have recently found a new interest in rooibos tea as well as pu'erh.
